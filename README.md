# NeTFactor
NeTFactor is an R code that tries to identify transcription factors (TFs) (or regulators in a generic network) that are most
likely regulating a given set of biomarkers. In the most ideal scenario, NeTFactor uses a computationally inferred context-specific
gene regulatory network and applies statistical and optimization methods to this network to identify a sparse set of
regulator TFs. For more info please see [1]

that combines network analyses with gene expression data to identify transcription
factors (TFs) that are expected to significantly regulate such a biomarker.

Our application of NeTFactor to an accurate gene expression-based biomarker of asthma identified
ETV4 and PPARG as the most significant TF regulators of the biomarker.
siRNA-based knock down of each of these TFs in an airway epithelial
cell line model demonstrated significant reduction of cytokine expression relevant to asthma, supporting NeTFactorâ€™s findings.
While PPARG has been associated with airway inflammation, ETV4 has not yet been implicated in asthma, thus indicating the possibility of novel, disease (asthma)-relevant discovery by NeTFactor. These results illustrate that the application of NeTFactor to multi-gene expression-based biomarkers like the asthma classifier may yield valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms and disease-relevant biological processes underlying diseases of interest.
